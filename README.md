# fuel_prices_NSW
Firstly I aim to fit and test a time series for my local petrol station using the NSW fuel check data, then I wish to expand into a more data science task of automatically fitting a model for every fuel station in NSW for any fuel type.

The following work is my own work, I have recently learnt the basics of time-series analysis from the University of Wollongong and this is an interest project to use and demonstrate these skills. The dataset used is a collection of datasets from the NSW fuel check website, this is a public access dataset and is available here: https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/fuel-check 

This project will be performed using R and will include the use of the tidyverse packages as well as the astsa package for time series ananysis.
